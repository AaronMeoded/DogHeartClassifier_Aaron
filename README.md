Abstract
Cardiomegaly is a prevalent condition in dogs, requir- ing accurate and timely diagnosis to improve treatment out- comes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as calculating the Vertebral Heart Score (VHS) from thoracic radiographs, are time-intensive and prone to inter-observer variability. In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based multilabel classification model for automated assessment of dog cardiomegaly using a dataset of anno- tated X-ray images. This approach addresses the inefficien- cies of manual measurement methods, providing a scalable and reliable solution for improving diagnostic workflows and ensuring consistency in veterinary medicine.
