## Abstract
Cardiomegaly is a prevalent condition in dogs, requiring accurate and timely diagnosis to improve treatment outcomes. Traditional diagnostic methods, such as calculating the Vertebral Heart Score (VHS) from thoracic radiographs, are time-intensive and prone to inter-observer variability. In this work, we develop a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based multilabel classification model for automated assessment of dog cardiomegaly using a dataset of annotated X-ray images. This approach addresses the inefficiencies of manual measurement methods, providing a scalable and reliable solution for improving diagnostic workflows and ensuring consistency in veterinary medicine. 


The results obtained by the proposed method are competitive with other non-pretrained approaches.
